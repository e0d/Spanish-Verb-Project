# Spanish Verbs Project

This is a conversion of the CSV representation of the [original work of Fred Jehle](https://users.pfw.edu/jehle/VERBLIST.HTM) to YAML.

The CSV representation and other serializations were provided by @ghidinelli on [github](https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs).

I have based the conversion off of a [currently unmerged pull request](https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs/pull/8) that fixes the affirmative and negative imperatives.

The desire to have a YAML representation of the verb database is to facilitate ease of editing, correction and contibution. The data model is ulimately cleaner, in my opinion, and more easily extensible.

Rather than providing multiple serializations, I will, over time, add scripts that generate artifacts from the canonical YAML form.  Those artifacts won't be checked in to source code control, but will be generated as needed.

Contributions of new verbs or fixes to existing ones are welcomed. Please do not make any contributions based on work that is not your own and not avaiable via an appropriate license like Creative Commons.

Flashcards for memorizing the definitions of the 600+ existing verbs have been uploaded to [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/es/469497341/spanish-verbs-from-fred-jehles-database-flash-cards/).
